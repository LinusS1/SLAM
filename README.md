# SLAM

SLAM: an app I made in 24 hours that’s like Shazam, but out of your way. I used it as an excuse to play with ShazamKit, the new framework made by Apple.

🎺 I use it when I want to listen to a song again later but I don’t care about what’s playing right then.

🍗 Super simple: left click to Shazam, right click to see the history.

🐮 Fun rounded, transparent windows!

📬 Takes care of its own memory leaks so you won’t have to (on average it used like 10mb of memory and it has a self destruct mechanism if it goes too high)

👑 It uses Core Data behind the scenes
